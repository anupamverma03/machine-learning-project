This project implements a Hybrid Face Detection Pipeline that combines traditional computer vision techniques with deep learning–based detection to achieve high accuracy and real-time performance on resource-constrained systems.

The system intelligently integrates Haar Cascade detection with Deep Neural Network (DNN) face detection, providing a balance between computational efficiency and detection robustness.
